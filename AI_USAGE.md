# Helper Tools

## ChatGPT
Used strictly as a writing assistant (structure, wording, grammar, and LaTeX phrasing) and for brainstorming.

## GitHub Copilot
Used as a coding assistant to speed up implementation work (debugging, small refactors, and readability improvements). In particular, it was used to help add or improve **docstrings, type hints, and short inline comments** so that key functions, variables, and constants are self-explanatory when first introduced (e.g., train/test split parameters, batching settings for transformer embedders, caching/invalidation logic, and diagnostic thresholds used in the evaluation). It was also used to improve the readability of `main.py` outputs by adding clear checkpoints and status messages. All Copilot suggestions were reviewed, edited when necessary, and validated by running the full pipeline; the final code and all methodological choices remain my responsibility.
